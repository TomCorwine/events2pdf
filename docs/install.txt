INSTALLATION


Installing the events2pdf app:
Unzip the events2pdf archive to the desired virtual env directory.  No further installation is needed, it is bundled with all python resources needed.  Source is included, to make any changes cd ~/src and edit file(s).  If pyinstaller isn’t available install it by:

pip install pyinstaller

pyinstaller may issued a warning that it wasn’t added to your path.  If so use the pyinstaller full pathname (given in the warning message) in the next step.

Then build the executable:

pyinstaller --onefile src/events.py

When pyinstaller completes the executable will be in dist/.  It can be moved anywhere but the resources directory must be in the same directory as the script. I recommending leaving it in dist/. Execute it from a shell to see any error output.  Currently logging is not enabled.

events.json is in the resources directory for testing purposes. For on demand schedules another source should be used

Virtual environment:

Installing virtualenv:
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv

Creating a virtual environment:
To create a virtual environment, go to your project’s directory and run venv.

python3 -m venv env 

The second argument is the location to create the virtual environment. Generally, you can just create this in your project and call it env. venv will create a virtual Python installation in the env folder.

Activating a virtual environment:
Before you can start installing or using packages in your virtual environment you’ll need to activate it. Activating a virtual environment will put the virtual environment-specific python and pip executables into your shell’s PATH.
UNIX:  source env/bin/activate
WIN:  .\env\Scripts\activate

confirm you’re in the virtual environment :
which python should give:
UNIX:  .../env/bin/python
WIN:   ...\env\Scripts\python.exe

Leave virtual environment:
deactivate

Reactivate:
UNIX:  source env/bin/activate
WIN:  .\env\Scripts\activate
